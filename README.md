## Overview

Frontendmentor is a great website that has various coding challenges to help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

### The challenge

The challenge was for me to build out the card and get it to look exactly like the design. And it was really a great and good challenge. 
And i also had to make users able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.

## My process

Well i started the process of building this project by first, writing the Html, and then using CSS to style it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learnt how to majorly use my flexbox extensively, and how grid sizing can actually be manipulated.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue working and developing my javascript and CSS skills.
